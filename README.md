# COMP330
This repository is the home of all of our source code, documentation, and data files that we will use to complete our quizzing system
in COMP 330. This README.md file will be updated since we are in the starting stages of design and just starting development. The
purpose of this project is to create a simple quiz system that will take user input and output whether or not they got the proposed
question correct. As of right now, we are continually working on reading in true/false questions from our json file. 

We are planning to use Java as our server code and JSON to store our data for easy access. The project is only in the making to be a simple
command line program but will be upgraded as time goes on.
